# Deep_Learning_Agents_Connect_Four
A network of programs for two agents in the game Connect Four. The first agent uses a MCTS algorithm to simulate games and ultimately choose the best move for a position (given a time constraint and # of simulations). The second agent uses alpha-beta pruning to search for the best move (with a depth of choice).
